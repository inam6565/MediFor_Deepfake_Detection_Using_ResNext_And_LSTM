# MediFor_Deepfake_Detection_Using_ResNext_And_LSTM
Final Year Project \
This projects aims in detection of video deepfakes using deep learning techniques ResNext and LSTM. We have achieve deepfake detection by using transfer learning where the pretrained ResNext CNN is used to obtain a feature vector, further the LSTM layer is trained using the features.
